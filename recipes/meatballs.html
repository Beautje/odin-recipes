    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free meatball recipe is easy to make. My kids loved them. (They couldn't tell the difference.) They are a fine substitute for those who cannot eat gluten. Use them in spaghetti or in meatball sandwiches (my kids' favorite).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pounds lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 ½ eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup gluten-free bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried onion flakes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon Italian seasoning, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (24 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine ground beef, eggs, bread crumbs, onion flakes, Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning in a large bowl. Mix well. Shape mixture into 4 to 5 dozen meatballs by hand or with a small scoop.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Cook meatballs in batches until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Drain off excess grease if needed. Return all cooked meatballs to the pan and add spaghetti sauce. Reduce heat and simmer until meatballs are no longer pink on the insides, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
