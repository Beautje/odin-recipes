# odin-recipes

hello Github! 

This is my first project i made and pushed to github.

First i created a index.html file and used the html boilerplate to get started.

Then i added 3 recipes and used headings,
images and links ,ordedlists and unordedlists.

I created a external css file Style.css and updated my site with css. 

I used classes and linked them to my css file and added basic background color , font size ,font weight, text-align, display.


I followed the Odin project to make this "website".
